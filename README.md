# Tauri mobile alpha + Apple ecosystem

This template currently supports macOS only.

Here is an Android version based on this template https://github.com/casey-SK/tauri-mobile-android

I've made a detailed step by step guide on `dev.to` covering particular set up steps https://dev.to/adimac93/tauri-mobile-for-ios-4dp6

## Warning

Tauri mobile is currently in alpha state. Please be aware that breaking changes may happen, thus making the newest version incompatible with previous ones. I'll try to do my best to keep this template up to date.

## Prerequisites

### XCode

#### Downloads

Newest stable XCode:
[XCode 14.3.1 download](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_14.3.1/Xcode_14.3.1.xip)

XCode CLI tools:
```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```
If you have other XCode CLI tools installed, make sure to set the correct version in XCode.

`XCode > Settings > Locations > Command Line Tools > [latest stable version]`

#### Set up

To enable application signing and testing directly on your mobile device you have to add Apple ID to XCode.

`XCode > Settings... > Account > + > Apple ID`

### Rust

#### Downloads

Install
```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
or update toolchain
```bash
$ rustup update
```

#### Set up

Add mobile targets:
```bash
$ rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```
If you'd like to use tauri CLI with cargo:
```bash
$ cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0-alpha"
```

### Pnpm

#### Downloads

```bash
$ brew install pnpm
```
or you can install it via `npm`
```bash
$ npm install -g pnpm
```

#### Set up

Download project dependencies:
```bash
pnpm i
```

### Development
Use `cargo` / `pnpm`

#### Set up
```bash
src-tauri$ cargo tauri ios init
```

#### Running dev server

If you don't have any mobile device connected you can run this command and choose simulation device.
```bash
src-tauri$ cargo tauri ios dev
```

#### Running on mobile device

1. iPhone `Settings > Privacy & Security`, scroll down to the Developer Mode list item and navigate into it. Then reboot your phone.
2. Connect your phone to your MacOS device with cable.
3. Open XCode project and open run device selection list `Manage Run Destinations > + > <your phone>`
4. Run `cargo tauri ios dev` - the application should be copied to your phone.
5. iPhone `Settings > VPN & Device Management > trust developer
6. Run the application

## Important

After opening the project in XCode some settings generated by `cargo tauri ios init` might be overwritten (especially after accepting recommended project changes).

```bash
$ cargo tauri ios open
```

To fix these issues (`PhaseScriptExecution failed` with code `65`) make sure to set up back correct bundle identifier from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and the development team (usually position with your Apple ID username).
To find these settings double click on `.xcodeproj` file in XCode file explorer and go to `Signing & Capabilities`.

If you don't care about your XCode tweaks, you can always remove `src-tauri/gen/apple` and rerun `cargo tauri ios init`.
